| -- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1 | **AF Debug.lvlib merged into Actor Framework.lvlib** ‚Äî DETT tracing is now encapsulated in `DETT Format.lvclass` implementing `Trace Format.lvclass`.                     | Consolidates debug utilities into a single library and makes it easier to extend trace formats.                |
|  2 | **`Generate Trace.vi`**\*\* loads trace formats dynamically\*\* (defaults to `DETT Format.lvclass`; override via `AFDebugTraceFormat` INI token).                         | Plug-in architecture lets you swap in custom trace sinks without recompiling the framework.                    |
|  3 | **Automatic actor registration** ‚Äî `Actor.vi` no longer sends *Register Actor Msg*; registration is performed inside `Actor Core.vi` just before message handling begins. | Removes boilerplate and speeds up actor startup.                                                               |
|  4 | **`Stop Autostop Nested Actors.vi`** (protected)                                                                                                                          | Gives parent actors a ‚Äúrogue-child panic button‚Äù to halt all autostop children while the parent keeps running. |
|  5 | **Testing Support Palette** ‚Äî Adds `Launch Actor.vi`, `Init Actor Queues FOR TESTING ONLY.vi`, and `Test Launch for Nested Actor Without Caller.vi`.                      | Enables fast, headless unit testing of actors in CI pipelines.                                                 |
|  6 | **Enqueuer / Last-Ack controls & constants now on palettes**                                                                                                              | Makes common datatype constants drag-and-drop accessible in development.                                       |
|  7 | **Improved PPL build experience** ‚Äî Specialty messages (Batch, Reply, Report Error, Self-Addressed) are now inside libraries; legacy copies are deprecated.               | Simplifies PPL builds and avoids duplicate symbol errors.                                                      |

## Overview

Actor Framework (AF) is NI‚Äôs reference implementation of the Actor Model in LabVIEW. It enables large-scale, message-oriented applications with asynchronous actors that can be launched, monitored, and shut down predictably. This repo is the **canonical upstream** for AF beginning with v2.x and is maintained under the MIT license.

- **Primary LabVIEW target:** 2020 SP1 or later (32- & 64-bit)
- **Package format:** VIPM (`.vip`) built by GitHub Actions for every merge to `main` and tagged release.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Install the latest package** from the [Releases](https://github.com/ni/actor-framework/releases) page or drag-and-drop the `.vip` onto VIPM.
2. Open `Examples/Actor Framework/` in LabVIEW to explore sample projects.
3. For IDE palette integration, restart LabVIEW after installation.

## Contributing

We welcome both code and non-code contributions ‚Äì everything from bug fixes and performance tweaks to documentation, testing, and discussion.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

External contributors must sign NI‚Äôs CLA once per GitHub account. A bot will prompt you on your first pull request; if not, NI staff will reach out directly.

### Standard Feature Workflow

1. **Check or Create an Issue**\
   ‚Ä¢ Discuss ideas on [Discord](https://discord.gg/q4d3ggrFVA) or [open a GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/ni/actor-framework/discussions).\
   ‚Ä¢ Once approved, the Steering Committee applies the label **[`Workflow: Open to contribution`](issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Workflow%3A+Open+to+contribution%22)**.  
2. **Assignment**\
   ‚Ä¢ Comment on any issue labeled [Workflow: Open to Contribution](https://github.com/ni/actor-framework/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22Workflow%3A%20Open%20to%20contribution%22).\
   ‚Ä¢ A maintainer assigns you and NI creates the feature branch.  
3. **First-Time Setup**\
   ‚Ä¢ Follow the steps in [`docs/self-hosted-runner.md`](docs/self-hosted-runner.md) *(in progress)* to register a self-hosted runner if you need one.\
   ‚Ä¢ Fork the repository to your GitHub account.  
4. **Feature Development**\
   ‚Ä¢ Clone (or sync) your fork.\
   ‚Ä¢ Implement changes and push to **`develop`** in your fork.  
5. **Build**\
   ‚Ä¢ CI builds a `.vip` and posts it as a **pre-release** on *your fork‚Äôs* Releases page.  
6. **Test**\
   ‚Ä¢ Install the pre-release package and verify the issue is resolved.\
   ‚Ä¢ *Note: the company name of your package will show the fork‚Äôs owner instead of ‚ÄúNI‚Äù.*  
7. **Pull Request**\
   ‚Ä¢ Open a PR targeting the feature branch in the upstream repo.\
   ‚Ä¢ Sign the CLA if the contribution is intended to ship with LabVIEW.\
   ‚Ä¢ The Steering Committee and maintainers review, test, and iterate.  
8. **Merge & Release**\
   ‚Ä¢ After approval, the PR is eventually merged into **`main`**.\
   ‚Ä¢ The functionality appears in the next LabVIEW release, and the GitHub release stream provides interim bug-fix and feature drops.
