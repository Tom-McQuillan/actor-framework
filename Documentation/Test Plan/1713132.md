# Notes

0. Obtain the **Images.zip** and **Test Harness Master.zip** files referenced by this test record from `\\nirvana\testingdb\LabVIEW\Extensions\AFPP`.  
1. The AF Project Provider does not resize the front panels of the VIs it creates. You may need to resize panels to show all controls and indicators.  
2. The expected text for all dialog boxes is paraphrased.  
3. `<Test Folder>` represents the path to a folder on disk created by the test operator.  
4. You may be asked to start from a clean version of **AFPP Test Harness.lvproj**. Obtain this project and its related files by copying the folder **Test Harness** and its contents from **Test Harness Master.zip** to a location of your choice on disk. `<Test Harness Folder>` represents the path to the copy of this folder you have created.  
5. Whenever a test step asks you to verify the appearance of a project, VI, or dialog, you can find the referenced image within the **Images.zip** file attached to this test.  
6. When testing on localized LabVIEW, messages will be placed next to the actor, instead of in the *"Abstract Messages for Caller"* or *"Messages for this Actor"* folders. This is expected behavior.  
   - **Note**: If you want the messages to be placed in the folders, change the names of those folders to match the folder names you see (in your language) when you create a new actor via right-clicking **My Computer** and selecting **"New > Actor"**.

## 2. Create an abstract message with data

1. Right-click on **Test Target.lvclass**.  
2. Select **Actor Framework » Create Abstract Message for Caller**.  
3. Enter **“Bob”** in the name field.  
4. Click **“OK.”**  
5. On the **Add Attributes** dialog, add the following controls, in order:  
   - i. **Numeric** (if testing on localized LabVIEW, give this control an English label of "Numeric")  
   - ii. **Path** (if testing on localized LabVIEW, give this control an English label of "Path")  
   - iii. **Dummy Class.lvclass** (find this class constant in the `Test Harness\Dummy Class` folder). If testing on localized LabVIEW, give this control an English label of "Dummy Class.lvclass."  
   - iv. After adding the controls, the dialog box should appear as shown in **Add Attributes Dialog.png** with the same English control labels as the screenshot.
